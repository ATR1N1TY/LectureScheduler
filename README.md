Bassicaly I really got bored with opening unorganized links of lectures and I even didn't knew when I had a lecture, which made my scores
worse, so with this script I have automated boring & repetitive tasks.

BTW, this script needs Task scheduler in order to run multiple times in a day to check if something is up
